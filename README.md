# random_lotto

Here is a simple random lottery number generator created using Python conditional statements.

The code above utilizes the random library to randomly select 6 numbers from a range of 1 to 45. The selected numbers are then sorted in ascending order and printed as the lottery numbers. Each time you run the code, you will get different lottery numbers.
